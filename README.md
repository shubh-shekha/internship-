# Baseball-Analytics
This is a data analysis project for making predictions based on Lahman's baseball data.<br/>

In the first part of the project, I applied K-means clustering model, linear regression model 
and ridge regression model to predict MLB(major league baseball) wins per season. In the second part 
of the project, I applied logistic regression model to predict which baseball players
will be voted into the Hall of Fame.<br/>
